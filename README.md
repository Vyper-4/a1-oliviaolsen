This project served as a good refresher on my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge after a summer and preceeding semester in which I didn't utilize them at all. I tried to challenge myself by looking up as few things as possible, and I think for using minimal Google searching, this is pretty solid.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the h1, h2, h3, p, li, and body tags. Most of these are just coloring stuff.
- **Added JavaScript animation to blind users**: Added a simple animation triggered by a button click to briefly change background color.
- **HTML Tags Used**: img, button, header(though it didn't make much difference)

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Asimovian Font from Google Fonts**: I used Asimovian as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Implemented color palette**: Screenshot put in repo, all colors used(even though they don't look great... oops)
